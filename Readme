# CNP35_CHIKV-nsP2-helicase-spiro

CHIKV nsP2 helicase inhibitor development campaign by HTS

An SGC Open Chemistry Networks Project devoted to the discovery and development of CHIKV nsP2 helicase inhibitors. 

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use, you can get started.

For the science background, head to the wiki or check out the living paper that is being written here.

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the FAQs.

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the "How To" Area
